## Assignment 2, Analysis of Summer and Winter Citibike data

Worked via email with Matt Sloane, Marc Tonetto, Will Xia, and Ozgur Akkas, data used and output folder contained within this repository.
Used the .iloc function to select specific months for both summer and winter and shared code with homework group via email. I decided to show summer months as April - September and winter months as October - March. Referenced (http://www.shanelynn.ie/select-pandas-dataframe-rows-and-columns-using-iloc-loc-and-ix/) for selecting by rows.

The higher number of cold spots in winter months can be attributed to the fact that more people are not riding in general due to the temperature, so neighbors of people not riding are also not riding. Also there may be a higher total number of positively autocorrelated census tracts for the winter months not only because fewer people are riding as a whole, but people who are riding are riding to a limited, specific number of stops in census tracts. These stops could be a short travel distance from one another or in areas where subway access is poor, making  the temperature less of an issue, or high volume routes for residents riding from home and work. In summer there is an influx of tourists making the over all number of riders higher which allows for a larger combination of start and stop locations. Weather is not a limiting factor so riders are more mobile and accessing a greater number of stations in many different census tracts.
