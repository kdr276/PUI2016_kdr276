# PUI 2016 HW11 - Kelsey Reid

## Assignment 1

Comleted Assignment 1 on my own and shared notebook with homework group Will Xia, Matt Sloane, Marc Toneatto, and Ozgur Akkas. Group discussed process
Converting the coordinates was done by referencing the geospatial analysis lab notebook.
I knew I had to create a variable to store the index location of the CUSP containing polygon but kept running into an error 'too many values to unpack'. The only important lists(columns) for the query were the index location and geometry so I used the zip function to combine only those values(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7999001/trouble-with-zip-function-in-for-loop-python). I stored the value of the index in a new variable to plot as the CUSP contained polygon
