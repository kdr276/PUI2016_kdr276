# PUI 2016 HW8 - Kelsey Reid

## Preform Peer Review 

Performed peer review of plots for Cai Yue and Zhu Jianghoa. Provided reviews in a markdown file along with a png of the individual plot I created from a screenshot of the plot found within each .ipynb file my peers created.


## Complete Data Lab From Class

Worked with homework group Matt Sloane, Will Xia, Marc Toneatto, Ozgur Akkas.

Followed directions from lab assignment identifying the community board variables in the multiple data sets. Matt developed the for loop used to remove implausible districts in the 311 call data. Decided to look at demographic information regarding language spoken.  

Used information found at (http://www.datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/02-index-slice-subset) to aggregate and sum columns I determined to represent 'low' and 'high' internet connection types'
